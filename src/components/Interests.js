              Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoor and exploring local cuisines. 
              On weekdays I go for walks daily. Sometimes, during the weekends I attend technical meetups. 
              I love to explore new places, meet new peoples and socialize with them.

              When forced indoors, I mostly enjoy reading books and novels. 
              Also in the free time I would do painting and sketching. 
              I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies, shows and web series for entertainment.
